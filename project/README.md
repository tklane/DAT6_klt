#DAT Project
This is a data science project for GA DAT6. Below is the proposal.
 
## Proposal
Examine computer incident data and relationships this data might show. The project will explore linear relationships between incident metadata, try to identify groups with cluster analysis, and build a model to try and predict type, frequency of incidents. Principal component analysis will be used in the data analysis to achieve dimensionality reduction prior to the classification technique.
